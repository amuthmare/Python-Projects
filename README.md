# Python-Projects
 My mother tongue is not English so there could be few grammatical mistakes, kindly let me know so I could learn better.
For all the python learning exercises and projects 
I am learning python and would recommend Python Bible on Udemy for beginners
Also a lot excercises with solutions are available  on https://www.w3resource.com/python-exercises/ (I am not advertising, just some good links to help people)
